**What is Husky?**
Husky is a tool that helps automate Git hooks, which are scripts that run at certain points in the Git workflow (e.g., before commits or pushes). It ensures consistent practices like linting, formatting, and commit message validation, helping maintain code quality and consistency across a project.

**Setting Up Husky with lint-staged**

1. Install Dependencies
2. Enable Husky Git Hooks
3. Configure lint-staged
4. Add Pre-commit Hook



**Benefits of Automation with Husky**
Consistency: Ensures uniform code quality and style.
Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks like linting and formatting.
Quality Control: Prevents issues from entering the codebase.
Faster Reviews: Reduces the need for manual style checks during code reviews.

By using Husky, you automate quality control in your Git workflow, keeping your codebase clean and saving time. Integrating it with GitHub Actions further streamlines the process with automatic CI checks like linting or testing.
